# Community Assembly Processes

Analysis of microbial communities can help to shed light on the processes that shape them, and this is essential for understanding microbial dynamics and migration. Microbial community assembly is governed by both deterministic and stochastic processes (Stegen et al., 2012; Zhou and Ning, 2017). Deterministic processes result from environmental conditions which select for organisms with adaptations towards a specific niche, and this leads to phylogenetic clustering within communities (Chase and Myers, 2011). In contrast, neutral theory assumes that stochastic events, such as random dispersal and demographic fluctuations (also known as ecological drift), shape community composition independently of species traits (Sloan et al., 2006). 

In order to identify mechanisms driving microbial community assembly, we employ two different null modelling approaches:

- **Normalized stochasticity ratio (NST):** determines the proportion of microbial community assembly which can be attributed to stochastic processes such as ecological drift, and implies that the remainder is due to deterministic processes (Ning et al., 2019).
- **Quantitative process estimate (QPE):** further quantifies deterministic assembly processes by estimating the proportion of deterministic assembly attributable to selection and dispersal, implying that the remainder is due to stochastic processes (Stegen et al., 2013).

## Normalised Stochasticity Ratio (NST)

NST yields a percentage value for each community called the stochasticity ratio (SR), indicating the quantity of stochastic processes that shaped that communityâ€”implying that all other remaining processes were deterministic. For this, we used 1000 randomisations with both ruzicka and jaccard distance measures, constraining taxa occurrence frequency proportionally and with both proportional and fixed constraints on richness. 

```{r analyse_nst, include=FALSE}
result <- nst(abund_table, meta_table, number_of_randomizations, distance_measure, abundance.weighted, null_model, SES, RC)
```

```{r plot_nst, echo=FALSE}
p <- plot.ECStochasticityRatio(result) + theme_light() + theme(
  strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#cdcdcd"),
  strip.text = element_text(color = "black")
)

print(p)
```

## Quantitative Process Estimate (QPE)

QPE is used to quantify assembly within an ecological framework based on selection and dispersal mechanisms. QPE measures the phylogenetic differences between sample groups (using a combination of Raup-Crick beta diversity and beta-NTI) to estimate the relative contribution of different assembly mechanisms acting simultaneously upon a community. This results in a model for each community which classifies the community as a proportion of each of the following ecological processes:

- **Variable selection:** when selective environmental conditions result in high compositional turnover
- **Homogenous selection:** when static environmental conditions result in consistent selective pressure
- **Dispersal limitation:** when low rates of dispersal (movement of microorganisms in space) result in high community turnover (this drives ecological drift)
- **Homogenizing dispersal:** when high compositional turnover is fuelled by high dispersal rates
- **Ecological drift:** when compositional turnover is neither the result of selection nor dispersal 

See the paper on QPE for more details: [Stegen et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00370)

```{r analyse_qpe, include=FALSE}
new_physeq <- join_phyloseq(abund_table, taxa_table, meta_table, taxa_tree)

result <- qpe(new_physeq)
```

```{r plot_qpe, echo=FALSE}
p <- plot.ECQuantitativeProcessEstimate(result) + theme_light() + theme(
  strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#cdcdcd"),
  strip.text = element_text(color = "black")
)

print(p)
```
