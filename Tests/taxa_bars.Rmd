## Core Microbiome

This notebook uses the EcologyCore API to generate core microbiome plots from a .biom file.

```{r data, include=FALSE}
#### Data Import ####

result <- import_data(biom_path, meta_path, tree_path)

abund_table <- result[[1]]
OTU_taxonomy <- result[[2]]
meta_table <- result[[3]]
OTU_tree <- result[[4]]

rm(result)
```

## Setting up Hypotheses

The hypothesis space sets up comparison groups for the analysis.

All you need to do is select the metadata columns you are interested in comparing and the code groups samples by the values in these columns.

Additionally, you can allocate a column to Connections if the data is paired.

```{r hypothesis, include=FALSE}
#### Hypothesis ####

# Hypothesis 1
label="Hypothesis1"
meta_table<-meta_table[!meta_table$Within_Dam_Sample %in% c("Piezometer"),]
meta_table$Groups<-paste(meta_table$Sand_Dam,meta_table$Within_Dam_Sample,meta_table$Sample_Time)
meta_table$Groups<-factor(meta_table$Groups, levels=c(
"SD_167 Community Scoop Hole May",
"SD_167 Community Scoop Hole July",
"SD_211 Community Scoop Hole May",
"SD_211 Community Scoop Hole July",
"SD_106 Downstream July",
"SD_167 Downstream May",
"SD_167 Downstream July",
"SD_106 Excavated Scoop Hole  May",
"SD_106 Excavated Scoop Hole  July",
"SD_167 Excavated Scoop Hole  May",
"SD_167 Excavated Scoop Hole  July",
"SD_211 Excavated Scoop Hole  May",
"SD_106 Hand Pump May",
"SD_106 Hand Pump July",            
"SD_167 Hand Pump May",
"SD_167 Hand Pump July",
"SD_211 Hand Pump May", 
"SD_211 Hand Pump July",
"SD_106 Open Well May",
"SD_106 Open Well July"
))


#Adjust abund_table to contain only those rows that got selected in the Hypothesis space
abund_table<-abund_table[rownames(meta_table),]
#After adjustment, get rid of OTUs that are all empty
abund_table<-abund_table[,colSums(abund_table)>0]
#Adjust OTU taxonomy
OTU_taxonomy<-OTU_taxonomy[colnames(abund_table),]
```

## Collate Taxonomy

This function is included in every analysis and serves to coalesce values in the abundance table at whatever taxonomic rank you specify.

```{r collate, include=FALSE}
#### Collate Taxonomy ####

abund_table <- collate_taxonomy(abund_table, OTU_taxonomy, which_level)
```

## Running the Analysis

Every analysis in EcologyCore is run by calling a single function. In this case, the function is called `alpha_diversity`.

```{r analyse, include=FALSE}
#### Analysis ####

dt <- alpha_diversity(abund_table, meta_table, grouping_column)

# Some absolutely fucking insufferable bug causes this to fail if its run in a package
# so fuck it I'm sticking it here instead
pval<-data.table::as.data.table(dt)[, list(pvalue = sprintf("%.2g", tryCatch({
   summary(stats::aov(value ~ .SD$.group.))[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][1]
  }, error = function(e) NULL))),
  by = list(measure)
]
  
result <- alpha_diversity_2(dt, pval, meta_table, grouping_column)

df <- result[[1]]
df_pw <- result[[2]]

rm(result)
```

## Including Plots

Once the analysis is complete, a separate function call draws the plots, and these are rendered here in the notebook.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
plot_alpha_diversity(df, df_pw)
```

## Saving Data

It is good practice to save the data produced by the analyses in a non-destructive way. This means that someone coming back to the analysis after some time can see the output of each step, for validation and reproducibility. This also saves one running the entire analysis again in order to redraw a plot or change one final piece. This becomes particularly useful for large, complex analyses that may take hours or even days to complete.

By default, we save a workspace image containing the output of each analysis step in an RData file. This provides an easy way for the user to open the data created by this software and analyse it further, independently. For users that don't use R, or that want a more portable format, we provide an option to export data in CSV format.

```{r save, include=FALSE}

```
